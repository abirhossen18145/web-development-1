    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>  is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<b>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry's <em>standard dummy text</em> ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was <i>popularised </i> in the 1960s with the release of <small> Letraset sheets
    </small>  containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
